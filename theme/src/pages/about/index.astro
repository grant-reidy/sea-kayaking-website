		<h3>Taylor Sherwood</h3>
		  <p>
        Hey I'm Taylor, I'm an undergraduate Civil Engineering and Spanish student. I'm originally from Milledgeville, Georgia, and 
        I assumed the position of Vice President in 2023. I am an Expedition Leader for the <a href="/expeditions/greenland">Greenland Expedition</a> 
        as well as the <a href="/expeditions/antarctica">Antarctica Expedition</a>. It has been my goal as VP to pioneer expeditions to new countries around the globe, 
        and to expand the reach of Sea Kayaking to Georgia Tech students.

      <h3>John Traendly</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm John. I'm a Georgia Tech alumnus, ME 1968 and MS IE 1973, and have been mentoring in the Sea 
          Kayaking program since 2012. I am an <a target="_blank" href="https://americancanoe.org/">American Canoe Association</a> Level 5 Instructor and a Level 3 
          Instructor Trainer. I have been fortunate to have staffed over 160 <a href="/ip-trips">IP trips</a> and been on all of 
          the <a href="/expeditions">Sea Kayaking expeditions</a>. Prior to kayaking, I was an IT and logistics executive, entrepreneur and Marine. 
          I'm looking forward to some great new adventures in the Sea Kayaking program.

      <h3>Grant Reidy</h3>
        <p>
          Hi I'm Grant, I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student. I'm originally from Jacksonville, Florida, 
          and I have been kayaking for over 8 years of my life already. I've been working with ORGT Sea Kayaking since 2021, 
          and I was a participant on the <a href="/expeditions/british-columbia">British Columbia Expedition</a> in August 2022. 
          I am an Expedition Leader for the <a href="/expeditions/greenland">Greenland Expedition</a>, as well as the 
          <a href="/expeditions/antarctica">Antarctica Expedition</a>. I recommend joining Sea Kayaking 
          for an experience like no other offered at Georgia Tech.
