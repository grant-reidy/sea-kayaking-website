			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Sea Kayaking enables Georgia Tech students to participate in and lead enriching paddling experiences across the world. 
			</p>
      <p>
        Sea Kayaking is run by a team of student volunteers tasked with leading open-enrollment 
        instructional programs (IPs), organizing sport logistics, and providing training opportunities 
        for current staff.</p>
        <p>Sea Kayaking offers many ways for students to get involved, including weekly sport community meetings, 
          roll schools, IP trips, and expeditions. Leadership opportunities are also available 
          through volunteer staff progression and sport officer positions. </p>

        Hi, I'm Taylor! I'm originally from Milledgeville, Georgia, and I study Civil Engineering and Spanish as an undergraduate student here at Georgia Tech. 
        I'm currently serving as this year's Sea Kayaking Vice President, and am an Expedition Leader for both international expeditions in 2023, 
        the <a href="/expeditions/greenland">Greenland Expedition</a> as well as the <a href="/expeditions/antarctica-2023">Antarctica Expedition</a>. I'm excited to help provide more incredible 
        paddling opportunities to the Georgia Tech community!

      <h3>Grant Reidy</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Grant. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student. I'm originally from Jacksonville, Florida, and I enjoyed kayaking along 
          the St. Johns River before coming to Atlanta. I've been working with Sea Kayaking since 2021, 
          and I was a participant on the <a href="/expeditions/british-columbia">British Columbia Expedition</a> in August 2022. 
          I am an Expedition Leader for the <a href="/expeditions/greenland">Greenland Expedition</a>, as well as the 
          <a href="/expeditions/antarctica-2023">Antarctica Expedition</a>. I recommend joining Sea Kayaking 
          for an experience like no other offered at Georgia Tech.

          Hi, I'm John. I'm a Georgia Tech alumnus, ME 1968 and MS IE 1973, and have been mentoring in the Sea 
          Kayaking program since 2012. I am an <a target="_blank" href="https://americancanoe.org/">American Canoe Association</a> Level 5 Instructor and a Level 3
